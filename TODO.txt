1. make graphs for each group, make sure the data makes sense and what not 
2. Remove outliers for some variables. Plot regression lines for each group 
    and make sure they are good. Run correlation tests for each group and average them out.
3. Run a multi-nomial linear regression on the dataset. 


Insights:
    Irrigation pumping seems to have the strongest indication of correlation 
    with observed values


OLD VALUES WITHOUT REMOVING OUTLIERS:
Feature   AvgCorr
0  Evapotranspiration -0.136044

3       Precipitation  0.256773

REMOVING OUTLIERS: 
              Feature   AvgCorr
0  Evapotranspiration -0.111096

1. Get the predicted baseflow from historical baseflow 
    So minus the average for each month 

2. Now for the resulting baseflow, there will be variance! 
    Use my features to predict the variance in the baseflow.
